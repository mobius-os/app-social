"""SSRF-safe transport for Common federation's outbound requests.

Common accepts peer locations from signed and unsigned protocol data.  Every
outbound Common request therefore crosses this one boundary: resolve and
validate with the platform's canonical policy, connect to that exact address,
preserve the original Host/SNI identity, reject redirects, ignore ambient
proxies, and cap the response before buffering it.
